  storyText: "You find yourself in a padded container. \nIn front of you is a small
    window at eye level. The glass is frosted and you are very cold. \nAbove your
    head a light flashes red. Your breath is visible as a cloud of white in your vision.
    \nYou shivver and try to rub your arms, only to find that your hands will not
    move. Looking down, you can see that you are restrained to the inside of the pod.
    \nIn front of your right pointer finger is a large red button, just barely in
    reach.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\n1. Press the button.\n2. Attempt to break free."
