  storyText: 'You press the button. The red light switches to solid red. Sirens blare
    outside of the pod.

    Slowly the seal on the door of the pod start to errupt, the pressure inside equalizing
    with the pressure outside.

    The restraints on your wrists pop off and retract into the pod.

    The door cracks loudly as the final seal breaks, and slides slowly to the side,
    revealing a dark room illuminated only by flashing red lights and a large monitor
    on the other side.

    Against all four walls are pods that look just like your own. A large door is
    visible on one wall.

    What do you do?


    1. Approach the monitor.

    2. Approach the door.'
